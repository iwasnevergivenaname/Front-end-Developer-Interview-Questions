* Explain the difference between cookies, session storage, and local storage?
    - cookies store data that needs to pass requests back to the server. they have a short expiration and must be used to
    send smaller piece of data (<4KB) and can be read server side. these can be made secure so they cannot be accessed
    on the client side. 
    - session storage is stored only for that session, meaning until that browser or tab is closed. data from the session
    is never transferred to the server, and the storage limit is larger than a cookie (at least 5MB). can only be read on 
    the client side.
    - local storage stores data for an unlimited amount of time and can only be cleared intentionally through clearing the 
    cache, or through javascript. this has the largest amount of storage available. can only be read on the client side.
